\usage{
hdi(object, credMass = 0.95, ...)

\method{hdi}{default}(object, credMass = 0.95, ...)

\method{hdi}{matrix}(object, credMass = 0.95, ...)

\method{hdi}{data.frame}(object, credMass = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object specifying the target distribution; see Details.}

\item{credMass}{a scalar [0, 1] specifying the mass within the credible
interval.}

\item{allowSplit}{if TRUE and the HDI is discontinuous, the beginning and
end of each segment are returned; see Value.}
}
\value{
a vector of length 2 or a 2-row matrix with the lower and upper
limits of the HDI, with an attribute "credMass".

\description{
Calculate the highest density interval (HDI) for a given probability mass,
see Details. The function is generic, with methods for a range of input
objects.
}
\details{
The HDI is the interval which contains the required mass such that all
points within the interval have a higher probability density than points
outside the interval. When applied to a posterior probability density, it is
often known as the Highest Posterior Density (HPD).

In contrast, a symmetric density interval defined by (eg.) the 10\% and 90\%
quantiles may include values with lower probability than those excluded.

For a unimodal distribution, the HDI is the narrowest interval containing
the specified mass, and the \code{hdi} function actually returns the
narrowest interval. This does not always work properly for multimodel
densities, where the HDI may be discontinuous (the horizontal black line in
the Figure below). The single interval returned by \code{hdi} (the blue
line) may incorrectly include values between the modes with low probability
density. The \code{density} method with \code{allowSplit = TRUE} gives
separate limits for discontinuous HDIs.

The default method expects a vector representing draws from the target
distribution, such as is produced by an MCMC process. Missing values are
silently ignored; if the vector has no non-missing values, NAs are returned.

The matrix and data frame methods expect an object with vectors of the above
type for each parameter in columns. The result is a matrix with parameters
in columns, and rows with the upper and lower limits of the HDI.

None of the above use interpolation: the values returned correspond to
specific values in the data object. Results thus depend on the random draws,
and will be unstable if few values are provided. For a 95\% HDI, 10,000
independent draws are recommended; a smaller number will be adequate for a
80\% HDI, many more for a 99\% HDI.

\note{
The origin of this function is
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEST/index.html}{the BEST package}.
In that package there is support for calculating the hdi on more data types
than just vectors, matrices, and data frames.

\examples{
# for a vector:
tst <- rgamma(1e5, 2.5, 2)
hdi(tst)
hdi(tst, credMass=0.8)
# For comparison, the symmetrical 80\% CrI:
quantile(tst, c(0.1,0.9))

# Now a data frame:
tst <- data.frame(mu = rnorm(1e4, 4, 1), sigma = rlnorm(1e4))
hdi(tst, 0.8)
apply(tst, 2, quantile, c(0.1,0.9))

# A severely bimodal distribution:
tst2 <- c(rnorm(1e5), rnorm(5e4, 7))
hist(tst2, freq=FALSE)
(hdiMC <- hdi(tst2))
segments(hdiMC[1], 0, hdiMC[2], 0, lwd=3, col='red')
# This is a valid 95\% CrI, but not a Highest Density Interval
